Welcome to the I TAKE Unconference 2015 Contest!

# About the Contest

The best reward for a software craftsman is to learn new things. Mozaic Works, the I TAKE Unconference organizers, want to create this opportunity for you every year. This contest is a set of challenges that will put your skills to the test. Do you know how to test systems? Can you point coding issues? Are you open to learning from other people? And, best of all, can you safely clean up existing code and improve its design? These are all core developer skills nowadays, and you'll greatly benefit from mastering them. This is just one opportunity to do so.

We hope that you will enjoy this contest. Oh, we almost forgot: **the person who gathers the most points wins a gadget**. That's a small reward compared to the learning, but we're sure it helps :).

Enjoy!

# How it Works

All you have to do to register is to fork this repository. You will need a github account for your real name. Once you've finished a challenge, make a pull request with a comment stating the challenge number.

If you want to improve a solution you've already submitted, just make another pull request with the same title. For each of the challenges, the jury will take into account the last pull request before the deadline.
