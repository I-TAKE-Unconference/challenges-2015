1.
user input data is not validated
the data that the user provides should be validated, i.e. it should be checked that the values entered are integer numbers between 1 and 9
this may be fixed by validating data read at lines: 19, 23, 33 and 37, in choice() method

2.
the game should end when a user wins or the table is filled in
the way it is implemented now, the game ends only when the table is filled; the game should check if a user won after each move; there is no need to continue playing if a user wins
this may be fixed by calling the eval() method from the choice() method (not the other way around), after each move a player makes

3.
the player's move is not validated; the way it works now, a user may choose an already occupied position of the board
the game should check for each move if the selected position is already filled in
this may be fixed by adding an if statement that checks if the chosen board position is fill in or not, before assigning a value to a board's position (in method choice())
