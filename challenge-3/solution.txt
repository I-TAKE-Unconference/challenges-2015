1. 
	tab is sized 10, board is only 9
	tab should be sized 9
	line 8

2. 
	int i variable in for (line 16,30) is for (i = 1; i <= 9; i++). 
	For a tab[9] it should be: for (i = 0; i <= 8; i++) or for (i = 0; i < 9; i++).
	line 16,30

3. 
	method eval() contains choice()
	eval() should do just the scoring evalution, not X/O choice 
	eval() line 44

4. 
	there is no evalution after each move
	after each move, you should evaluate if a winner exist, eval() in each for() cycle after the moves, as in line 25 and 39
	The for cycles are at line 16 and 30

5. 
	if a winner is found, the game doesnt stop. 
	It should stop. At the end of for cycles, same as 4. We make eval() to return an int e = 1 for winner
